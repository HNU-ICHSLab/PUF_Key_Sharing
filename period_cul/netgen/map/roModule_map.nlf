INFO:NetListWriters:633 - The generated Verilog netlist contains Xilinx SIMPRIM simulation primitives and has to be used with SIMPRIM
   simulation library for correct compilation and simulation. 
INFO:NetListWriters - Xilinx recommends running separate simulations to check for setup by specifying the MAX field in the SDF file and for
   hold by specifying the MIN field in the SDF file. Please refer to Simulator documentation for more details on specifying MIN and MAX
   field in the SDF.
INFO:NetListWriters:665 - For more information on how to pass the SDF switches to the simulator, see your Simulator tool documentation.
